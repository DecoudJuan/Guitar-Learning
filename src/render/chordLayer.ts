/**
 * Turning a judged chord into things to draw on the neck.
 *
 * Kept apart from both the judge and the canvas: the judge decides what is
 * true, this decides what is worth showing, and the Overlay only knows how to
 * put a circle somewhere. The middle step is where the teaching happens — most
 * of what is *true* about a wrong chord is noise a student cannot act on.
 *
 * What earns a place on screen:
 *
 *   - Every finger the chord wants, coloured by whether it is there yet.
 *   - An arrow from a wrong finger to where it belongs. One correction, drawn,
 *     beats four sentences.
 *   - The open and muted strings at the nut, because "don't play the thick E"
 *     is half of what makes a beginner's chord sound bad and is invisible in
 *     any finger-only display.
