/**
 * Marking the chord.
 *
 * The rule that shapes this whole file: **"wrong" teaches nobody anything.**
 * A student who is told the chord is wrong has learnt only that they are stuck.
 * A student who is told "your ring finger is one string too low" has been given
 * the next move. So the judge never returns a verdict on the chord — it returns
 * one per finger, and lets the coach decide what to say first.
 *
 * The chord itself says which finger goes where, so there is no matching
 * problem to solve: the ring finger is judged against the place the ring finger
 * belongs. That is also what makes the diagnosis specific rather than a nearest-
 * neighbour guess that would happily report two fingers as "swapped".
