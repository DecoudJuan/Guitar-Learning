/**
 * The shape of a fretboard, in the fretboard's own units.
 *
 * Everything here lives in a flat plane measured in *scale lengths*: x runs
 * from 0 at the nut to 1 at the bridge, y runs across the neck with 0 down the
 * middle. Nothing here knows about cameras, pixels or perspective — that is
 * the homography's job (see `Fretboard`). Keeping the two apart is what lets
 * the fret maths be checked on paper.
 *
 * Two facts do all the work:
 *
 *   - **Frets are logarithmic.** Fret n sits at `1 - 2^(-n/12)` of the scale,
 *     because twelve of them have to halve the string. The 12th fret is
 *     therefore at exactly 0.5 — which is why it is the landmark the student
 *     is asked to click.
 *   - **The neck is a trapezoid.** It is narrow at the nut and wider up the
 *     neck, and that taper is linear. Ignoring it puts the thin-E string a
 *     couple of millimetres off by the 12th fret, which is a whole string's
 *     width of error.
