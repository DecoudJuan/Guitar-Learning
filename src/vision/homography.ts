/**
 * The four-point homography: the one piece of maths that turns a photograph of
 * a fretboard back into a fretboard.
 *
 * A flat rectangle photographed from an angle comes out as a quadrilateral, and
 * not just any quadrilateral — the parallel fret wires converge, and the ones
 * further away sit closer together. An affine transform cannot express that;
 * a projective one can, and it is fixed entirely by four point pairs.
 *
 * So: the student marks four corners, and from then on every fret of the
 * instrument has a known place in the picture, and every fingertip in the
 * picture has a known place on the instrument.
 *
 *   [u']   [h0 h1 h2] [x]                   u = u'/w'
 *   [v'] = [h3 h4 h5] [y]      with         v = v'/w'
 *   [w']   [h6 h7  1] [1]
 *
 * Pure arithmetic, no camera, no DOM — so it can be checked against pencil and
 * paper, which it was.
